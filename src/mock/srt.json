00:03:15,279\nThe vegetation may be burning\nat the base of that rainbow.\n\n21\n00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,188\nWhy do we feel a fairy tale sensation\n\n22\n00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,942\nfrom that small set\nof seven-color information?\n\n23\n00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,582\nHave you ever thought about that?\n\n24\n00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:27,959\nNo.\n\n25\n00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:31,322\nI mean,

00:03:50,537\nIt's true, our job is\nto convey the truth to others,\n\n31\n00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:56,182\nbut the moment we obtain any\ninformation, be it true or false,\n\n32\n00:03:56,182 --> 00:04:00,518\nwe must not stop thinking.\nWe must not limit ourselves to merely determining\n\n33\n00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:03,358\nwhether the information is true or false.\n\n34\n00:04:03,358 -->

00:04:15,687\nJust thinking about something doesn't\nchange whether it's true or not, right?\n\n37\n00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,842\nYes, it <i>does</i> change.\n\n38\n00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,252\nDo

00:05:04,055\nWe are in 1711,\n\n49\n00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:11,729\nand perhaps it would be better to start inside the <i>Advenna Avis</i>, as it crosses the Atlantic.\n\n50\n00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,263\nOr, perhaps,\n\n51\n00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,558\nit would be better to start\nwith the unpleasant business\n\n52\n00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:21,642\nthat happened aboard the\ntranscontinental <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i>,\n\n53\n00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:24,534\nwhich was covered up.\n\n54\n00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,412\nIn any case, Carol,\n\n55\n00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:35,618\nyou chose November 1930\nas the beginning of the story.\n\n56\n00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,658\nWhy?\n\n57\n00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:39,090\nMr. Vice-President, it's because...\n\n58\n00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,511\nIt's because, you see, I thought\nabout what would be easiest to understand.\n\n59\n00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:49,617\nIt was at this point that these\nincidents first appeared before us.\n\n60\n00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:50,644\nThat's why.\n\n61\n00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:52,672\n156 points.\n\n62\n00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,468\nOut of how many?\n\n63\n00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:57,388\nIndeed, it is easier to understand.\n\n64\n00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,587\nBut, Carol,\n\n65\n00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:01,837\nyou must think about\nmore than just the timeline.\n\n66\n00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,031\nThe characters are also crucial.\n\n67\n00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,783\nLet's say...\n\n68\n00:06:07,618 -->
